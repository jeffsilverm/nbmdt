    <h1><a name="mozTocId308862" class="mozTocH1"></a>The Network Boot
      Monitor Diagnostic Tool (NBMDT)</h1>
    <h2><a name="mozTocId235879" class="mozTocH2"></a>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The network boot monitor diagnostic tool (NBMDT) is a python
      program that specifically checks for network problems.&nbsp; In a
      future version, it might be more generalized.&nbsp; It has several
      main purposes:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A system startup time, it runs as a startup script and
        verifies that all of the network, from the ethernet to the
        servers, are working properly</li>
      <li>Once the system is running, it monitors everything
        periodically and gives a visual indication that something is
        wrong (Boot)<br>
      </li>
      <li>A system administrator or a network administrator can run it
        at any time to test that the network is working properly
        (Monitor)</li>
      <li>If something is wrong, the NBMDT tries to give as much
        diagnostic information as possible (Diagnostic)<br>
      </li>
      <li>A system administrator can run it to capture the current state
        of the system, which is "nominal"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The program is an out growth of a talk I gave at <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NyiSXTFujouZWrTUxXusOmwivYENxqvBJX-C9qi-sng/edit#slide=id.p">LinuxFestNorthwest
        in Bellingham, Washington, April 2017</a>.&nbsp; In this talk, I
      discussed how you could use linux software to diagnose network
      problems.&nbsp; One of the comments I got from my audience is "Is
      there a program that contains all of the tribal knowledge you
      have?".<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId341106" class="mozTocH3"></a>What are the
      advantages of the NBMDT over other network monitors?</h3>
    <p>The NBMDT is designed to run in a terminal window, not on a web
      server.&nbsp; Thus, it can pack more information into less screen
      real estate.&nbsp; Updates are more efficient, because things that
      do not need rapid monitoring don't get updated that frequently,
      while things that need close attention can be updated with little
      bandwidth.</p>
    <p>NBMDT is specifically designed to run under linux.&nbsp; Although
      it might be possible to port it to other operating systems might,
      it&nbsp; be difficult to do so.&nbsp; The reason why is that NBMDT
      gets a lot of its information from the /proc and /sys pseudo file
      systems.&nbsp; So it doesn't have to fork a bunch of child
      processes (although it can, if you want to, for example, re-used a
      nagios monitor).<br>
    </p>
    <p>To a large extent, NBMDT is auto configuring.&nbsp; When NBMDT is
      run for the first time, or after a deliberate configuration
      change, the NBMDT can be run with the <tt>--nominal</tt> switch,
      which causes it to explore the network and create a known
      configuration file.&nbsp; This configuration file contains:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The state of Network Interface Cards (NICs) (up or down),</li>
      <li>the MAC address</li>
      <li>the ARP cache</li>
      <li>IPv6 neighbors</li>
      <li>routing table</li>
      <li>IPv4 address</li>
      <li>IPv6 address</li>
      <li>listening UDP, TCP, and SCTP ports.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="mozTocId888884" class="mozTocH2"></a>Documentation</h2>
    <p>This file has introductory documentation.&nbsp; In this file, I
      lay out what the NBMDT actually does.&nbsp; There is also a <a
        href="How_to_install_use_and_test_monitor.sh.html">user document</a>
      that has the instructions that a user needs in order to actually
      the program.&nbsp; There is a <a
        href="../../../nbmdt/docs/nbmdt_requirements.html">requirements
        document</a>, which is derived from this document.&nbsp; There
      is also a <a href="nbmdt_test_plan.html">test plan</a>, which is
      derived from the <a
        href="file:///home/jeffs/nbmdt/docs/nbmdt_requirements.html">requirements
        document</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision to write these documents
      in HTML was deliberate because I wanted to cross reference every
      requirement to a test in the test plan, and backwards.<br>

      displays:</h3>
    <p>The state of an item being monitored or reported on can be easily
      indicated by the back ground color:</p>
    <p>
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    </p>
    <span style="color:#808080;font-style:italic;"></span>
    <dl>
      <dd> <span style="background-color:green;">Normal</span></dd>
      <dt>All is well.&nbsp; The interface is working properly in all
        respects<br>
        <br>
      </dt>
      <dd> <span style="background-color:yellow;">Degraded or slow</span></dd>
      <dt>The monitor is measuring traffic flow through the interface or
        the delay required to reach the interface, and it is outside
        acceptable limits.&nbsp; The interface is still working.</dt>
    </dl>
    <dd><span style="background-color:cyan;">The interface is at
        increased risk of failure because a dependency is down.<span></span></span></dd>
    <dt>However, the dependency has some redundancy so the fact that
      there is an upstream failure does not mean that this interface is
      down. For example, there are multiple DNS servers. If a server
      fails, the resolver will pick a different name server. So DNS will
      be working, but there will be fewer servers than normal and a
      greater risk of subsequent failure.<br>
      <br>
    </dt>
    <dd><span style="background-color:red">Down cause unknown</span></dd>
    <dt>The resource is flunking its test, cause unknown
      <br>
      <br>
    </dt>
    <dd><span style="background-color:magenta"> Failed due to an
        upstream dependency.</span></dd>
    <dt>The resource is flunking a health check for some known reason.
      For example, if an applicationm depends on a database, and the
      database fails, then the application will fail. In this case, the
      database will be marked as "failed cause unknown" and the
      application will be marked as "failed due to an upstream
      dependency"<br>
    </dt>
    <dl>
      <dd><span style="color:white;background-color:Blue ;">The
          configuration file is wrong</span></dd>
      <dt>The NBMDT is looking for a resource that is in the .ini file,
        but can't be found in the system. Or there is a resourece that
        is <b>not</b> in the configuration file, but the NBMDT found
        it. The MAC address of the interface is wrong. This means that
        the .ini file is wrong, perhaps because it is running on the
        wrong system or perhaps the configuration changed<br>

    <br>
    <h2><a name="mozTocId569121" class="mozTocH2"></a>Operational modes
    </h2>
    <p>The NBMDT has 4 operational modes: nominal, startup, and
      monitoring.<br>
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Nominal</dt>
      <dd>In nominal mode, NBMDT assumes that everything is as it should
        be.&nbsp; Guided by the permanent configuration file, it
        explores the NICs and the network that the NICs are connected to
        and then builds a running configuration file in .ini file. Then,
        as necessary, it will read the contents of that file into its
        memory and use that as the basis for monitoring.&nbsp; The
        system administrator can compare that configuration file against
        the original to figure out what changed.<br>
      </dd>
      <dt>Boot</dt>
      <dd>In Boot mode, NBMDT reads the permanent and running
        configuration files, and then displays each item in the list, in
        order.&nbsp; The use case is that the NBMDT is invoked in a
        startup script, where there is no cursor addressing.</dd>
      <dt>Monitor</dt>
      <dd>In monitor mode, NBMDT reads the permanent and running
        configuration files, and then displays each item in a compact
        display using VT-100 cursor addressing to change the
        display.&nbsp; In this mode, the operator has the ability to
        mark certain things as known to be down.&nbsp; If something is
        known to be down, then the monitor will not generate any further
        alerts.&nbsp; In monitor mode, each test has a frequency
        associated with it, so that critical items can be detected
        rapidly, and less critical items happen less frequently.&nbsp;
        For example, testing that name resolution works is critical and
        should be tested frequently.&nbsp; Testing that a particular
        name server is working is less critical, because name servers
        are redundant.<br>
      </dd>
      <dt>Diagnostic</dt>
      <dd>In diagnostic mode, NBMDT attempts to figure out why something
        is not working.&nbsp; So, for example, look at:
        <ul>
          <li>arp cache to see if the MAC address of the other machine
            is known.</li>
          <li>counters in the physical links to see if they are
            incrementing.</li>
          <li>flags on a physical server to see if there is an
            indication of a problem.</li>
          <li>routes - is the default gateway or default router
            pingable?</li>
          <li>Diagnosing the neighbor discovery protocol</li>
        </ul>
        A future extension of NBMDT is going to be a dependency
        description language which allow the operator to pinpoint what
        has failed by considering all of the things that depend on it.</dd>
      <dt>Test</dt>
      <dd>In test mode, NBMDT does all of the testing that monitor mode
        does, but there is no frequency associated with any test.&nbsp;
        The end result is GO/NOGO. There is no attempt made to diagnose
        why there is a problem.</dd>

      files</h2>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId84646" class="mozTocH3"></a>Permanent
      configuration file</h3>
    <p>The permanent configuration file is generated by the system
      administrator using any ASCII/Unicode text editor.&nbsp; It is in
      JSON format.&nbsp; The file is organized as a list.&nbsp; Each
      element in the list is a description of something that should be
      monitored.&nbsp; The description includes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>If not a network device, then how to monitor it.&nbsp; This is
        either a python subroutine or a program (such a monitoring
        program for Nagios)</li>
      <li>The row and column where the device status should be displayed
        in monitor mode</li>
      <li>What it depends on.&nbsp; This is a boolean expression, with
        the names of all of the things that device depends on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, for example, both IPv4 and IPv6 depend on the device being
      UP.&nbsp; If the device is DOWN, then it is assumed that IPv4 and
      IPv6 went down with it.&nbsp; Furthermore, all of the remote DNS
      name servers went down.&nbsp; NTP became degraded.&nbsp; The
      applications that are listening are still listening.&nbsp; NBMDT
      generates only one alert, because it understands the dependencies.</p>
    <p>The permanent configuration file also records some system
      specific things, such as where the ip command is.</p>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId304901" class="mozTocH3"></a> <br>
    </h3>
    <h3><a name="mozTocId867742" class="mozTocH3"></a>Nominal
      configuration file</h3>
    <p>The nominal configuration file is generated by the nbmdt program
      at the command of the system administrator.&nbsp; It is in JSON
      format.&nbsp; When nbmdt is run in nominal mode, it builds a
      description of the system and then creates the nominal
      configuration
      file.&nbsp; This file is assumed to be correct.&nbsp; It has to be
      changed only when the system changes.</p>
